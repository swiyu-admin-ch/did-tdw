An official Swiss Government project made by
the [Federal Office of Information Technology, Systems and Telecommunication FOITT](https://www.bit.admin.ch/)
as part of the electronic identity (e-ID) project.

**⚠️ PARTIAL IMPLEMENTATION ⚠️**

*Beware, this Rust library implements historical [Trust DID Web - did:tdw - v0.3 specification](https://identity.foundation/didwebvh/v0.3)
only partially while focusing solely on [DID resolution](https://identity.foundation/didwebvh/v0.3/#read-resolve).*

Although the library is still required by [DID Resolver](https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/didresolver), it will be kept
in the future as legacy and solely for the sake of backward compatibility, as [newer version of the specifications](https://identity.foundation/didwebvh/v1.0) is currently being implemented.

## Using the library

The library can be used either directly in Rust as is.

### Rust

The library can be used directly in Rust by adding the following dependency to your `Cargo.toml`:

````toml
[dependencies]
did_tdw = { git = "https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/did-tdw", branch = "main" }
````
