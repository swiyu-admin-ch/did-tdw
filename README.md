# DID TDW

An official Swiss Government project made by
the [Federal Office of Information Technology, Systems and Telecommunication FOITT](https://www.bit.admin.ch/)
as part of the electronic identity (e-ID) project.

**⚠️ PARTLY OUTDATED ⚠️**

*Users must not use this library to create new DIDs, as they won't be compatible.*

This project has been superseded by [DID Toolbox](https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/didtoolbox-java). Parts of this library are still required by [DID Resolver](https://github.com/swiyu-admin-ch/didresolver). This library will vanish in the near future, and the required parts will be relocated to Resolver.

## Using the library

The library can be used either directly in Rust as is.

### Rust
